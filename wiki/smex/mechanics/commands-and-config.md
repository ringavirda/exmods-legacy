title: Commands and config
covers:
  - "smex:toolmold*"
order: 7
version: 0.10.0
---

Every number on the other pages is a config value, and all of them can be changed in place. The
commands belong to Expanded Library, not to this mod: the mod id is the section name, so tuning
this mod is always `/exmod config smex ...`.

## The commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `/exmod config smex` | lists every key and its current value |
| `/exmod config smex <key>` | reads one key |
| `/exmod config smex <key> <value>` | sets one key and writes it to disk. Applies live |
| `/exmod recipes smex` | reads the recipe cost level |
| `/exmod recipes smex <normal or cheap>` | sets it. Applies on the next world reload |
| `/exmod molds <plate, ingot, rod or all>` | reports whether those molds are available |
| `/exmod molds <plate, ingot, rod or all> <on or off>` | switches them. Placed molds stop casting at once; the clay-forming recipe and the in-game handbook entry change on the next world reload |
| `.exmod measure <metric or imperial>` | a per-player display choice from Pipes and Power Expanded: litres, atm and C, or gallons, psi and F. It changes the panels, never the simulation |
| `.exmod network hi` and `.exmod network unhi` | Expanded Library's per-network block highlight, which is the fastest way to see what a pipe or canal run is actually connected to |

The server commands need the `controlserver` privilege. The two that start with a dot are client
side and need nothing.

Older in-game text names `/exmod steel <level>` for the recipe level; that command does not exist.
Use `/exmod recipes smex <level>`.

## The files

The `smex` section of `ModConfig/ex_values.json` holds the values below. The machines re-read it
every tick, so a `/exmod config` change reaches a furnace that is already running. A saved value
that is not a number, or is negative, resets to its default on load.

The `smex` section of `ModConfig/ex_recipes.json` holds the recipe cost catalogue: which grid
recipes and which right-click construction the level applies to, with a `normal` profile filled in
from the recipes as shipped and a `cheap` profile at half cost. Edit the per-recipe numbers there;
the command only picks which profile is live, and the change lands on the next world reload.

Both files are shared with the other mods on Expanded Library, one section per mod. A world from
0.9.9 or earlier carries `smex_values.json` (or the older `smex.json`) and `smex_recipes.json`. The
first load folds them into the two sections with their values kept and renames them to `.migrated`.

Upgrading the mod can reset individual keys. Each release that rebalances something lists the keys
it pushes out, and only those are reset; the rest of your tuning is kept. 0.9.7 reset most of the
furnace and converter numbers at once, because a saved config from before it left a furnace that
could not reach its own melting point.

### Molds and recipes

| key | default | sets |

| `EnableIngotMold` | true | whether the double ingot mold exists |
| `EnableRodMold` | true | whether the quad rod mold exists |
| `RecipeLevel` | `normal` | the live profile in the recipe catalogue |

## The recipe catalogue

The catalogue names what the level applies to, not what it costs: the right-click construction of
the converter vessel, and the grid recipes of the tuyere, the furnace door, the furnace tap, the
converter's intake, control and transmission, the cowper stove intake, the heat sink, the air
blower, the smoke stack intake, both hoppers, the molten barrel, every molten canal piece, and the
three slag paths. Each entry carries a `normal` profile read from the shipped recipe and a `cheap`
profile at half of it, and both are yours to edit.

## Reading a value back

If a change through `/exmod config` does not seem to show, read the value back with the same
command: it prints what the server actually holds. `RccBrokenDropsRatio` was reset to 1.0 for
everyone in 0.9.6, so on a current install breaking the converter returns all of its construction
materials whatever the file says.
