# Getting started with steam power

Everything in this mod is one chain: water feeds a boiler, the boiler drives an engine, and the
engine turns exactly one sub-machine. A plant works when that chain closes into a loop that keeps
its own boiler full while the coal burns. This page builds the smallest loop that does, in the
order to build it.

It is iron-age work. Before you start you want a wrench, a pond or a lake, and enough iron for a
boiler, an engine and a few dozen pipes.

## What to have ready

| what | why |
|---|---|
| [[Fluid Intake]] | the only thing that makes water |
| a bucket, or a [[Manual Fluid Pump]] | fills the boiler before there is any steam |
| [[Cornish Boiler (block)]] frame, then 22 iron or steel plates, 16 nails and strips, 8 rods and 44 fireclay bricks | the vessel, raised in three right-click stages |
| [[Pipe Passthrough (Bend)]] and [[Pipe Passthrough (Straight)]] in fireclay, and a fireclay [[Pipe Outlet]] | the firebox walls carry the water line and the exhaust |
| fireclay bricks and an iron hatch door | the firebox itself |
| a chimney | to vent the firebox |
| [[Watt Engine]] frame, then 4 plates, 24 rods, 12 nails and strips and 36 fireclay bricks | the engine, raised the same way |
| two [[Piping (Pressure Valve)]] | one keeps the boiler from breaking the engine, one keeps the feed from adding to the boiler's steam |
| [[Fluid Pump]] | the sub-machine that closes the water loop |
| [[Piping (Straight)]], bends and junctions | two or three dozen covers a first plant |

Iron pipe is fine for everything here. Steel only becomes necessary at the Lancashire Boiler.

## 1. Water

Set a Fluid Intake on open water with a full three-deep cube of water directly under it, and keep
it at least 6 blocks from any other intake. Pipe its output to where the boiler will stand.
Nothing in this mod creates water: every pump only moves what an intake produces.

## 2. The boiler

Build a Cornish Boiler. Its own page has the footprint, the build order and the first firing; the
parts that matter to the rest of this page are that feedwater enters underneath through a fireclay
Pipe Passthrough (Bend), steam leaves the top, and exhaust leaves the far end.

Fill it before you fire it. It needs 150 L to start boiling, and there are two ways to get it
there.

- By bucket. Hold right-click on the lid to open it, then right-click it with a bucket of water to
  pour the bucket in. Pouring fills the vessel up to 500 L.
- By hand pump. Run the intake line into a Manual Fluid Pump and the pump's delivery into the
  passthrough under the boiler, then hold right-click on the pump to crank it. It moves 2 L/s,
  which is slow, and a piped feed fills the vessel only to 400 L, half of it, which is still
  enough.

## 3. The exhaust

Stand a chimney on the fireclay Pipe Outlet, which sits at the far end of the boiler, opposite the
firebox. A boiler makes 16 L/s of exhaust and a chimney draws exactly that. The fire draws only
through a chimney or a smoke stack: an open pipe end carries the exhaust away but gives no draught.
Get this wrong and the fire snuffs itself ten seconds after you light it.

## 4. Steam, and the valve that saves the engine

Pipe the boiler's top connector toward where the engine will stand. Put a Piping (T-Junction) in
that run and hang a Piping (Pressure Valve) off the branch, with the valve's copper-trimmed side
facing the run and its other side open to the air or piped to a vent. Set the gate to 3.5 atm: the
valve starts at 1 atm when placed, right-click it with an empty hand to raise the gate in steps of
0.25 atm, sneak and right-click to lower it.

This is not optional. A Cornish boiler chokes at 5 atm and a Watt Engine starts wearing toward a
burst above 4 atm, so an ungated line breaks the engine in a minute of running. The engine runs
from 2 atm, so 3.5 atm holds it inside its band with room below the break. The boiler makes 32 L/s
of steam and the engine draws 30, so once the line is up to the gate the valve vents the other
2 L/s.

Hang the valve off the run the engine is on, not in the line between the two: a pressure valve
holds down the side its input face reads, and one set in-line feeds the far side until both sides
match instead.

## 5. The engine

Raise a Watt Engine beside the line and bring the steam pipe to its inlet face, which is at its
back: the machine always faces one way and there is no rotate. It engages at 2 atm and delivers
its power to whatever sits in its drive cell, and to nothing else. An engine with no sub-machine
draws no steam at all, which is not the same as safe: the over-pressure timer still runs, and a
relief valve cannot hold down a run nothing is drawing from. Shut the steam line or let the fire
die before you leave an engine standing empty.

Its condensate drain is on the side. Pipe it back toward the boiler if you want that litre a
second back, or leave it to spill.

## 6. The sub-machine, and closing the loop

Set a Fluid Pump in the engine's drive cell. It snaps itself to the right facing. Pipe the intake
line into the pump's underside and its delivery up into the boiler's feedwater passthrough, and
the loop is closed: the boiler makes steam, the steam drives the engine, the engine works the
pump, the pump keeps the boiler full. Behind a Watt engine the pump moves up to 30 L/s, which is
far more than the 2 L/s the boiler is boiling away.

That surplus needs a way out. The pump delivers at three quarters of the engine's inlet pressure,
about 2.6 atm behind an engine at 3.5, and water fed into a boiling vessel above 1 atm flashes to
extra steam on the way in, a litre of steam per litre per atm over 1, on top of what the fire
makes. The feed main is held at the pump's pressure whenever the pump or the engine's condensate
leaves it brim full, and a relief valve on the main holds it down to the valve's gate while it
spills. Put a Piping (T-Junction) in it and hang a
second Piping (Pressure Valve) off the branch the same way as the steam one, copper-trimmed side to
the run and the other side open to the air, gated at 0.5 atm. It sprays out whatever the boiler
does not take and keeps the feed main under 1 atm.

In this plant about 11 L/s go round. The pump draws 11 L/s from the intake and the engine's
condensate adds 1, the boiler takes the 2 it boils away, and the water relief valve sprays the
other 10.

Now the boiler no longer needs filling by hand.

## 7. The whole plant

The figure below is the plant this page builds, played from a test run of the current code. Each
machine links to its own page and shows its state, each pipe run carries its rate, and the legend
under the drawing names the colours. The steps build it in the order of the sections above.

::plant{page="Starter steam power setup" recording="starter-steam-power"}

1. Set the Fluid Intake on the pond and pipe it to the Fluid Pump's underside. The intake makes
   only the water the pump draws, :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="pond.flow"} in this plant.
2. Raise the Cornish Boiler, stand the chimney on its exhaust outlet, and fill the vessel by bucket
   or with a Manual Fluid Pump before lighting the fire. The boiler stops boiling at
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="boiler.max"}, and held there with the fire burning it bursts.
3. Pipe the steam to the Watt Engine's inlet, with a T-junction in the line and the steam relief
   valve on its branch, gated at :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="steam-valve.gate"}. The engine runs from
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="engine.engage"} and wears toward a break above :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="engine.break"}, so the gate keeps it
   inside that band. The boiler makes :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="steam.flow"} and the engine draws
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="engine.steam"}; the valve vents the other :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="steam-valve.vent"}.
4. Set the Fluid Pump in the engine's drive cell and pipe its delivery into the boiler's feedwater
   passthrough. The engine's condensate drain joins the same main and adds :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="engine.water"}.
   Water does not compress: the main holds no more than its pipes' volume, and once brim full it
   stands at the pump's delivery pressure, the engine's inlet pressure times
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="engine.efficiency"}.
5. Put a T-junction in the feed main and hang the water relief valve off its branch, gated at
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="water-valve.gate"}. Feed water above :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="boiler.boostAbove"} flashes to extra steam in
   the boiler on top of what the fire makes, so the valve keeps the main below that. The boiler
   takes the :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="boiler.feed"} it boils away and the valve sprays out the other
   :plant{recording="starter-steam-power" value="water-valve.vent"}.

## 8. What to add next

- A Mechanical Power Generator instead of the pump, to turn axles. It needs its own engine and
  boiler, because one engine drives one sub-machine.
- A Steam Condenser on the return, to get spent steam back as feedwater.
- A Lancashire Boiler and a Cornish Engine for the high-pressure tier, on steel pipe.
- An Air Blower from Steelmaking Expanded, which is the reason most people build steam at all: the
  Bessemer converter takes blast at 2.5 atm or more, which only a steam blower reaches. A waterwheel
  on a Twin-Tub Blower blows a first blast furnace but tops out at 2.0 atm.

## Where the details are

Pipes and pressure for capacity, leaks and bursting. Boilers for water, fire and the explosion.
Steam engines for the bands, the throttle and repair. Mechanical power and pumps for shaft load
and the pumps. Valves and outlets for the fittings. Commands and config for the numbers and how to
change them. Compatibility for other mods.
